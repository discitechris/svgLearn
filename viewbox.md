# viewBox

* you set the viewBox attribute on the  element. 
* The **value of this attribute** consists of four numbers that represent the **`minimum x-coordinate`**, **`minimum y-coordinate`**, **`width`**, and **`height`** of the user coordinate system you want to superimpose on the viewport.
* The numbers you specify for the value of the viewBox attribute may be **separated by commas or whitespace.**
* **If** either the **width or height is 0**, **none of your graphic will display.** **It is an error to specify a negative value for the viewBox width or height.**
